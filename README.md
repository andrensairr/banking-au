Westpac QuickSuper Library

QuickSuper allows employers to make contributions on behalf of their employees to other parties such as superannuation funds. 

Clients instruct QuickSuper to make contributions to funds on behalf of employers and their employees through the use of the Contribution File. This file may be uploaded via the QuickSuper web interface.  The Contribution File has a comma separated (CSV) format. This format allows files to be viewed and edited in Microsoft Excel or similar products. 

This library implements the CSV file specification (with the assistance of FileHelpers) as well as the validation of the data to ensure the file isn't rejected.

Written to v2 of the specification, last modification 2014-09-28.
